# Maintenance_Planning_Tool

This will be the repository of a very complete application for planning heavy maintenance, allowing you to create a gantt chart of maintenance work, material reports and instructions for the productive areas. 

To use this tool, the following databases will be necessary:  

1. Database with the turns and skills of the technicians 
2. Database with the work to be done. 
3. Database of all maintenance tasks, includes task name, duration, special conditions, among other things. 
4. Database with the opening times of the areas of the object to be maintained.




The idea is to convert a very complete planning tool currently created with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) into an optimized web application.


**The following code has been developed by different people over time in a maintenance plant. We appreciate the constant work and to continue with the open source spirit that you started now we publish it here so that it continues to grow.
